Zingo Andersen - Creator of this nice piece of software. 
     I'm an old Amiga fart, that likes hacking around. 
     I have two kids and a wife, both take there share of my private Life so 
     lately there has not been so much hacking after I come home from my day 
     job as a Realtime Consultant from Enea. 
     I live in Sweden in the town called Lund.

     outdoors playing in the woods and archipelago of sunny Stockholm, 
     Sweden. Cheers!

     getting the plugin configurable, thanks for the help.
     
Peter Hunnisett - Peter Hunnisett is a bipedal mammal hailing from 
     Canada who's wondering if you have to come from a northern country 
     to contribute to this software.
     Zingo's Comment: Peter insted of whising for feature just plain wrote them :) 
     He is responsible for  the cloning,rename/move and selectable commit handling. 
     He as also refacorated the messy code that I have wrote.
